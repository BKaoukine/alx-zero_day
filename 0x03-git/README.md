# Gitignore

This directory contains an exercise for learning how to use `.gitignore` files in Git repositories.

## Purpose

Git repositories often contain a variety of files and directories that are not meant to be tracked by Git, such as build artifacts, configuration files, and temporary files. These files can clutter up the repository and make it harder to track changes and collaborate with other developers. To address this issue, Git provides a way to specify files and directories that should be ignored by Git using a `.gitignore` file.

## Exercise

In this exercise, you will create a `.gitignore` file in your Git repository to ignore certain files and directories. Follow these steps:

1.  Create a new file named `.gitignore` in the root directory of your repository, if one does not already exist.
2.  Open the `.gitignore` file in a text editor.
3.  Add the name of the file or directory that you want to ignore to the `.gitignore` file, on a new line.
4.  Save and close the `.gitignore` file.

You can verify that your `.gitignore` file is working correctly by adding a file or directory that matches the pattern you specified to your repository, and then running `git status`. The file or directory should be marked as ignored by Git.

## Usage

Feel free to use this exercise to learn and practice how to use `.gitignore` files in your Git repositories.
